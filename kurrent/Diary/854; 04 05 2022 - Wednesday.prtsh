Dear Diary, I honestly fell victom to my addiction to videos again (-_-). Well I'll just tell you about my day cause I can't rlly talk about anything else lel. Well in the morning I woke up not tired! And I immedietly got up and got my crap ready for school. After I arrived to school I went to my locker (the lowest level one), ducking under the person above me while I hastily grabbed all the things I needed for my first to periods of the day (Science and History). Once I had all the stuff I needed, I ran to my first period (Science) at S1. Once I got there I sat down and got ready for a boring day ahead. I can't remeber much about the class, it was mainly about the 3/4 states of matter and questions about it... OH WAIT FCK I STILL HAVE SCIENCE HOMEWORK TO DO! Welp, I'll do it later... Now moving on with my day! After I finished Science, I hurried off to my next class (History). Basically what happened during class was we learn't about ancient china and stuff. After that I went to recess and all a really did was advertise my resource pack. Afterwards, I grabbed what I needed for my next two periods (English, Focus Group). Hurryed off to English, after English, I went to Focus Group, and after FG I ran to robotics club and all we really did there was play with the robot parts and try to make something useful. After that I went to my last period and took the bus home. WHELLP THAT WAS MY DAY! imma go now

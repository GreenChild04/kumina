Dear Diary, today was quite the normal day. Alright, today I had quite alot of motivation and to give you perspective I got up in the morning instantly. Now you may be wondering why I had this sudden boost of motivation (accually you probabally know already cause you're me and you know how these things happen) well the thing is and now that I'm writing this I feel really stupid about is that I'm talking to my grade 6 crush again; or well this year's crush aswell (depends how you see it). Okay you might be hella confused like 'what the fuck is past me talking about and who is this so called grade 6 crush' well Imma fill you in! So in grade 6 I was in a friend group (technically I am still in it) called 'The Deck Gang' and we were called that because we always hanged-out on the Grade 6 Deck. Now, ummm, sooo, everyone in the 'Deck Gang' knows I had a crush on Brodie (Member in the 'Deck Gang') but no one knows that I used to have a crush on Kate (Also a 'Deck Gang' Member) but that mini crush died quite quickly. Oh ye I almost forgot! Asher had a crush on Kate after me and but he and everyone else doesn't know that I had a crush on Kate (They probably won't know until this diary entry is leaked or I just tell them after all of this ordeal was over) and Asher probably still has a crush on Kate. Now moving back to me, during grade 6 covid, I kind of developed a crush on another 'Deck Gang' member 'Brodie'. So instead of doing nothing about this mini crush, I did both the most stupid and most brilliant desision at the time changing my personality, outlook on the world and just 'me' in general. What I did was ask her out in a cringy message you can read in py past logs. After I wrote the message, she replyed in quite a few long messages basically saying yes. I was estatic, with the same motiviation boost I had yesterday night. But unfortunatly or fortunatly (depends how you see it) she broke up with me before the day day was over! RIP 2021 Ethan. So to cut things short, I was heart broken at a time where isolation was the norm. I don't really consider that crush on her as a 'true' crush, more as a mini crush; a crush that kinda pops up for no reason. Now after the lockdown, I started trying to talk to her more during 'Deck Gang' meetings. But I could never think of a talking point. Now at this point I was stupid, I liked her for no reason (now that I think about it, it was probably cause I thought she looked attractive) so I had stupid selfish ideas that work. And the one which worked the most was downloading a game she really liked; 'Genshine Impact'. After downloading the game I got to socialise with her alot more and I started to develop a 'true' crush; something that can't just die and be forgotten about. I started to like her alot and before I knew it I was head over heels for her also known as; I became a simp. So I would be doing stuff like moving spots and pushing past people just to talk to her. This shit made it quite obvious that I had a crush on Brodie so basically everyone in the Deck Gang knew about the crush (Brodie Probablly knew aswell). But it all started to go down-hill grade 6 was quickly ending and I fell into panic (Brodie goes to a different highschool to me; I go to Highvale and she goes to Emaus). To cope with all the shit, I kinda just forced myself to not be attracted to her and it worked! Well sort of, over the holiday I completely lost my feelings for her and the crush continued to die throughout term one of highschool. So when the latest Deck Gang meet up arrived I talked and made jokes just like I had no crushes on anyone (that's cause I really didn't have any feelings for brodie). Now finally in early term 2 (which is now) I can finally tell you what happend. So, completly out of the blue, she started a conversation and slowly we started to talk a bit more and these conversations slowly made me regain a crush I thought I had eliminated. Now that all that recapping is done, I gonna try to start a conversation with her, wish me luck! Also future me tell me what the outcome of all this drama and stuff is here: __________
